## Your learning journey

OKP4 is designed to bring the tools for builders and communities to solve trust and incentive issues and unlock value through applications based on shared datasets and algorithms.

OKP4 is a public blockchain built to share and orchestrate any off-chain resource. Its architecture is specifically designed to:

- Share any off-chain resource (datasets, algorithms, services...).
- Define and enforce highly customized rules on-chain (access rights, business models, governance models...).
- Build applications leveraging the shared resources according to the on-chain rules.
